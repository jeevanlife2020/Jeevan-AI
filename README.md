# Jeevan-AI

JEEVAN platform is AI- enabled, it is trained over 10 years of water consumption data over different postal areas. It can predict the water usage of all the postal areas for the upcoming 5 years. By using JEEVAN we can get a clear scenario of the water scarcity that may occur in the upcoming years and as a result we can get aware of the scenario and control the unnecessary wastage of water.

We have used the ARIMA model for the prediction of the total water usage and then push the predicted data to the IBM Cloudant, and the predicted graph is plotted in the dashboard.
